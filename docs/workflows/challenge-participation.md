        "checks": checks,
        "next_steps": get_next_steps(checks)
    }
```

## Phase 5: Peer Verification System

### Verification Algorithm

**Verifier Selection**:
- Random selection from active participants
- Exclude submission creator
- Prioritize users with good verification history
- Ensure minimum geographic/demographic diversity
- Limit verification load per user

**Verification Interface**:
```json
{
  "submission": {
    "id": "submission-uuid",
    "participant": "alice_fitness",
    "challenge_day": 15,
    "proof_type": "video",
    "file_url": "https://secure-presigned-url",
    "description": "Day 15 - 100 push-ups completed",
    "submitted_at": "2025-10-15T18:30:00Z"
  },
  "challenge_context": {
    "title": "30-Day Push-up Challenge",
    "day_requirement": "Complete 100 push-ups with proper form",
    "success_criteria": "Full range of motion, controlled movement"
  },
  "verification_options": {
    "approve": "Submission meets requirements",
    "reject": "Submission does not meet requirements",
    "unclear": "Need more information or better proof"
  }
}
```

**Verification Decision Process**:
1. **Evidence Review**: Examine photo/video proof
2. **Requirement Check**: Compare against challenge criteria
3. **Quality Assessment**: Verify proof clarity and completeness
4. **Fairness Consideration**: Apply consistent standards
5. **Feedback Provision**: Helpful comments for improvement
6. **Decision Recording**: Submit approval/rejection with reasoning

### Consensus Mechanism

**Threshold System**:
- **Default Threshold**: 2 approvals required
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Based on challenge difficulty and stakes
- **Weighted Voting**: Experienced verifiers have higher weight
- **Tie Breaking**: Creator or admin can cast deciding vote
- **Appeal Process**: Disputed decisions can be escalated

**Verification Status Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_verification_status(submission_id: str) -> str:
    verifications = get_verifications(submission_id)
    challenge = get_challenge_for_submission(submission_id)
    
    approvals = sum(1 for v in verifications if v.verdict == "approve")
    rejections = sum(1 for v in verifications if v.verdict == "reject")
    threshold = challenge.verification_threshold
    
    if approvals >= threshold:
        return "verified"
    elif rejections >= threshold:
        return "rejected"
    elif len(verifications) >= challenge.max_verifications:
        return "approved" if approvals > rejections else "rejected"
    else:
        return "pending"
```

### Verification Quality Control

**Verifier Incentives**:
- **Reputation System**: Build credibility through consistent, fair verification
- **Verification Rewards**: Small token rewards for active verifiers
- **Badges & Recognition**: Public recognition for quality verifiers
- **Priority Access**: Early access to new features and challenges
- **Community Status**: Verified verifier badges and permissions

**Quality Metrics**:
- **Consistency Score**: Agreement with other verifiers
- **Response Time**: Speed of verification completion
- **Feedback Quality**: Helpfulness of verification comments
- **Participation Rate**: Regular verification activity
- **Dispute Resolution**: How often verifications are appealed

## Phase 6: Challenge Completion & Payouts

### Completion Determination

**Individual Completion Criteria**:
```python
def check_participant_completion(participant_id: str, challenge_id: str) -> dict:
    challenge = get_challenge(challenge_id)
    submissions = get_participant_submissions(participant_id, challenge_id)
    
    # Calculate completion percentage
    required_submissions = challenge.duration_days
    verified_submissions = sum(1 for s in submissions if s.status == "verified")
    completion_rate = verified_submissions / required_submissions
    
    # Determine success based on challenge rules
    success_threshold = challenge.completion_threshold or 0.8  # 80% default
    is_completed = completion_rate >= success_threshold
    
    return {
        "participant_id": participant_id,
        "completion_rate": completion_rate,
        "verified_submissions": verified_submissions,
        "required_submissions": required_submissions,
        "is_completed": is_completed,
        "completion_details": get_completion_breakdown(submissions)
    }
```

**Challenge End Processing**:
1. **Final Verification**: Complete any pending verifications
2. **Participant Assessment**: Determine individual completion status
3. **Winner Calculation**: Identify successful participants
4. **Prize Pool Distribution**: Calculate individual payouts
5. **Transaction Processing**: Execute wallet transfers
6. **Notification Delivery**: Inform all participants of results
7. **Challenge Archival**: Move to completed status

### Payout Distribution Algorithm

**Equal Split Distribution** (Most Common):
```python
def calculate_equal_split_payouts(challenge_id: str) -> dict:
    challenge = get_challenge(challenge_id)
    winners = get_successful_participants(challenge_id)
    total_stake_pool = challenge.total_participants * challenge.stake_amount
    
    if len(winners) == 0:
        # No winners - platform captures all stakes
        return {
            "payout_type": "platform_revenue",
            "total_pool": total_stake_pool,
            "platform_revenue": total_stake_pool,
            "participant_payouts": {}
        }
    
    # Equal distribution among winners
    payout_per_winner = total_stake_pool // len(winners)
    remainder = total_stake_pool % len(winners)
    
    payouts = {}
    for i, winner in enumerate(winners):
        # Distribute remainder to first few winners
        extra = 1 if i < remainder else 0
        payouts[winner.user_id] = payout_per_winner + extra
    
    return {
        "payout_type": "equal_split",
        "total_pool": total_stake_pool,
        "winner_count": len(winners),
        "platform_revenue": 0,
        "participant_payouts": payouts
    }
```

**Performance-Based Distribution** (Advanced):
```python
def calculate_performance_payouts(challenge_id: str) -> dict:
    winners = get_successful_participants(challenge_id)
    challenge = get_challenge(challenge_id)
    total_pool = challenge.total_participants * challenge.stake_amount
    
    # Calculate performance scores (completion rate, verification quality, etc.)
    scored_winners = []
    for winner in winners:
        score = calculate_performance_score(winner, challenge_id)
        scored_winners.append((winner, score))
    
    # Weighted distribution based on performance
    total_score = sum(score for _, score in scored_winners)
    payouts = {}
    
    for winner, score in scored_winners:
        payout_percentage = score / total_score
        payout_amount = int(total_pool * payout_percentage)
        payouts[winner.user_id] = payout_amount
    
    return {
        "payout_type": "performance_based",
        "total_pool": total_pool,
        "scoring_method": "completion_quality_weighted",
        "participant_payouts": payouts
    }
```

### Automatic Payout Processing

**Transaction Pipeline**:
1. **Payout Calculation**: Determine winner rewards
2. **Advisory Locks**: Lock all winner wallets for updates
3. **Balance Updates**: Credit winner wallets atomically
4. **Ledger Entries**: Create detailed transaction records
5. **Notification System**: Send payout notifications
6. **Challenge Status**: Update challenge to "paid_out"
7. **Audit Trail**: Log all payout activities

**Payout Transaction Record**:
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "tx-payout-uuid",
  "transaction_type": "CHALLENGE_PAYOUT",
  "user_id": "winner-user-uuid",
  "amount": 167,
